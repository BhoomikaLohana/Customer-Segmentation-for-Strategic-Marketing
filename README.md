# Customer-Segmentation-for-Strategic-Marketing
## Project Overview
In the dynamic world of fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG), understanding customers at a deeper level is essential for businesses. By customizing marketing strategies to reach distinct customer segments, companies can boost sales, strengthen brand identity, and enhance overall business efficiency.

This project will guide you through the steps of customer segmentation and the creation of targeted marketing strategies for specific customer clusters. Using data-driven approaches allows us to design impactful marketing campaigns that align with the unique preferences and needs of each segment.

5. Customer Profiling Sumaary
6. Summary of Findings and Conclusion

# Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is a customer data file containing various demographic and transactional information. It includes key attributes such as:

Demographics: Age, Education, Marital Status, and the number of children (Kidhome, Teenhome).
Purchasing Behavior: Details on customer spending across different product categories, including wines, fruits, meat products, fish products, sweet products, and gold products.
Target Variables: Information on spending and segmentation, used to categorize customers into different clusters.
This rich dataset allows us to perform detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and implement customer segmentation through clustering algorithms. The goal is to segment customers based on their spending behavior and demographic features to create tailored marketing strategies.

# Analysis
In this project, I performed customer segmentation to identify distinct groups based on spending behavior using K-Means clustering. The analysis revealed three primary customer segments: Mid-Spending Families, Affluent Couples, and Budget-Conscious Families. Each segment was characterized by unique spending patterns and demographic traits, such as family size, marital status, and product preferences. Mid-Spending Families tend to make moderate purchases, with a focus on family-oriented products. Affluent Couples are more inclined toward premium and luxury products, valuing exclusive offers and personalized experiences. Budget-Conscious Families are primarily price-sensitive, responding well to discount-driven marketing strategies. These insights enable businesses to tailor their marketing efforts more effectively, ensuring that resources are allocated to target each segment’s specific needs and preferences, thereby enhancing customer engagement and maximizing return on investment.

# EDA Result Summary:

## Age Group

85% of customers are over 40 years old, with no customers under the age of 18.

## Number of Children at Home

71.52% of customers have at least 1 child at home.

## Education Level

88.53% of customers hold a bachelor’s degree or higher.

## Income Level

66.8% of customers earn more than $40,000 annually.

## Marital Status

66.46% of customers are not single.

## Spending Capability

31.73% are low spenders (0-100).
41.40% are mid spenders (101-1000).
26.87% are high spenders (1000+)

# Result:
The K-Means clustering analysis has revealed three distinct customer segments:

Cluster 0 (Mid-Spending Families) - 41.40%

This group consists of families with moderate spending habits. They are best reached with marketing strategies that focus on family-oriented products and offer value-driven deals. Tailoring promotions to address practical family needs would likely resonate with this segment.

Cluster 1 (Affluent Couples) - 26.64%

These individuals tend to have higher disposable incomes and prioritize quality over price. Targeting them with premium, luxury offerings, exclusive discounts, and sophisticated experiences is most likely to drive engagement and conversion.

Cluster 2 (Budget-Conscious Families) - 31.96%

Characterized by a focus on saving and cost-effective solutions, this segment responds well to discounts and affordable pricing. Marketing messages that emphasize value, practicality, and deals can effectively attract and retain these customers.

# Conclusion

By understanding these clusters, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies to appeal to the unique preferences and financial behaviors of each group. For example, Cluster 0 may appreciate bundling offers, Cluster 1 might value personalized experiences or loyalty programs, and Cluster 2 could be drawn to flash sales and limited-time discounts. Segmenting customers in this way enables more efficient resource allocation and maximizes the return on marketing investments.
